* Finish up tables
* Check how many nested quantifiers we have (and how branching they are)
* Move file to NNF/SNF
** and then to equi-sat PNF with relations for inner quantifiers
* Try and run ADT (term) solution for some Dafny file (after PNF)
* ADTs in cvc5
* (Instantiating nested quantifiers by choosing subset of quantifiers
to instantiate and assuming true for others)
* What is the syntactic set of terms that we need for instantiations
** types?
